title: 2048 Game on CC3200
description: A standalone version of 2048 implemented in embedded C on a CC3200 with IR input, OLED display, temperature visualization, and AWS IoT score uploads.

# 2048 Game ‚Äì EEC 172 Final Project

This is a standalone, embedded implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, created on the **TI CC3200 microcontroller**. It uses an **OLED screen** for display, an **IR remote** or **tilt sensor** for input, a **temperature sensor** to adapt visuals, and **AWS IoT** integration to post high scores to the cloud.

## üìù Description (0.5 pt)

The player slides tiles on a 4√ó4 grid. Identical tiles that collide merge into one with double the value. A new tile (2 or 4) appears each move. The goal is to reach 2048, though players can continue afterward. The game ends when no moves are left.

---

## üß† Functional Specification (2.5 pts)

The software is built around a finite state machine:

- **INIT** ‚Äì Initializes Wi-Fi, OLED, and sensors
- **IDLE** ‚Äì Waits for valid gesture or IR input
- **PROCESS_INPUT** ‚Äì Updates grid and game logic
- **UPDATE_DISPLAY** ‚Äì Redraws screen and score
- **GAME_OVER** ‚Äì Displays result, posts to AWS
- **RESET** ‚Äì Waits for reset or timeout to restart

## üîß Implementation (5 pts)

### Game Logic
- 2048 mechanics (sliding, merging, spawning new tiles)
- C array-based grid system with movement vectors
- State transition logic driven by GPIO/IR interrupts

### Input Handling
- IR signals decoded via timer-based GPIO interrupt
- Accelerometer polled periodically as optional fallback

### Display
- SSD1351 OLED driven over SPI
- Game board redrawn on every state update
- Font rendering via `glcdfont.h` and GFX primitives

### Temperature Integration
- TMP006 I2C sensor reads ambient temperature
- Visual style changes (e.g., blue/cool, red/hot themes)

### Cloud Integration
- High score sent to AWS IoT using MQTT via CC3200 Wi-Fi
- Server receives, logs, and returns leaderboard data

---

## üß™ Challenges (2 pts)

- **IR decoding**: Needed precise edge detection and timing to decode NEC protocol correctly
- **Display flicker**: Fixed by optimizing redraw logic and partial screen refresh
- **Tile movement bugs**: Required multiple code rewrites to preserve merge rules
- **AWS/MQTT latency**: Solved with async retry logic and manual payload optimization

## üöÄ Future Work (0.5 pt)

- Add sound using PWM and speaker
- Expand leaderboard with persistent storage
- Enhance UI with animation effects
- Switch to capacitive touch input
